                                   Structure

1. Define a structure Employee with member variables id, name, salary.

struct Employee
{
    int id;
    char name[20];
    float salary;
};

2. Write a function to take input employee data from the user. [ Refer structure from
question 1 ]

#include <stdio.h>

struct Employee
{
    int id;
    char name[20];
    float salary;
};


int main()
{
    struct Employee e;
    
    printf("Emter the Employee id : ");
    scanf("%d",&e.id);
    printf("Emter the Employee name : ");
    scanf("%s",&e.name);
    // gets(e.name);

    printf("Emter the Employee salary : ");
    scanf("%f",&e.salary);

    printf("\nYou Entered : Employee id -> %d | Employee name : %s | Employee salary : %f",e.id,e.name,e.salary);
}

3. Write a function to display employee data. [ Refer structure from question 1 ]

#include <stdio.h>
#include "myfunctions.h"

int main()
{
    struct Employee e;
    
    printf("Enter the Employee id : ");
    scanf("%d",&e.id);
    printf("Enter the Employee name : ");
    scanf("%s",&e.name);
    // gets(e.name);

    printf("Enter the Employee salary : ");
    scanf("%f",&e.salary);

    displayEmployee(e);

    return 0;
}

4. Write a function to find the highest salary employee from a given array of 10
employees. [ Refer structure from question 1]

#include <stdio.h>
#include "myfunctions.h"

int main()
{
    struct Employee e[10];

    // Take input
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        printf("Enter the Employee-%d id : ", i);
        scanf("%d", &e[i].id);
        printf("Enter the Employee-%d name : ", i);
        scanf("%s", &e[i].name);
        printf("Enter the Employee-%d salary : ", i);
        scanf("%f", &e[i].salary);
    }

    // Maximum Salary
    printf("Maximum Salary of the Employee is %d.", maxSalary(e, 10));

    return 0;
}

5. Write a function to sort employees according to their salaries [ refer structure from
question 1]



6. Write a function to sort employees according to their names [refer structure from
question 1]
7. Write a program to calculate the difference between two time periods.
8. Write a program to store information of 10 students and display them using structure.
9. Write a program to store information of n students and display them using structure
10. Write a program to enter the marks of 5 students in Chemistry, Mathematics and
Physics (each out of 100) using a structure named Marks having elements roll no.,
name, chem_marks, maths_marks and phy_marks and then display the percentage
of each student.
